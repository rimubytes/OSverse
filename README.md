# OSverse

This repository is dedicated to exploring and building fundamental concepts of operating systems from the ground up. The goal of this project is to understand how operating systems work by working through hands-on exercises, reading materials, and small coding projects.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

Operating systems (OS) are the backbone of computer systems, managing resources, processes, and interactions with hardware. In this project, we aim to:

- Learn OS basics like processes, memory management, file systems, and device drivers.
- Implement foundational components of an OS.
- Experiment with systems programming to deepen understanding of low-level concepts.

This project is inspired by courses like MIT's 6.S081 and other resources, providing a self-paced environment to explore OS development.

## ðŸ›  Technologies

- C/C++: Core language for low-level OS development.
- Assembly: Some exercises may require working with assembly code.
- QEMU: For emulating and testing code in a virtualized environment.
