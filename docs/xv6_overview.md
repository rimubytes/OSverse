# xv6 Overview

xv6 is a simple, Unix-like teaching operating system that provides an environment to illustrate operating system concepts. It loosely follows the structure and style of Unix Version 6, but is implemented in ANSI C for a multi-core RISC-V processor. xv6 provides a narrow interface whose mechanisms combine well, offering a degree of generality.

## Key Concepts

- **Kernel**: The kernel is special program that provides services to running programs. Xv6 is implemented as a monolithic kernel, which means that the kernel interface corresponds to the operating system interface and the kernel implements the complete operating system
- **Processes and Memory**: A process in xv6 consists of user-space memory (instructions, data and stack) and kernel-private, per-process state. Processes are time-shared and have a process identifier(PID) associated with them. Processes can create new processes using the fork system call. xv6 uses page tables to give each processes its own address space.
- **Traps and System Calls**: The RISC-V hardware uses traps to handle events such as sytem calls and exceptions. xv6 uses a trampoline page to switch between user and kernel page tables during a trap. The ecall instruction is used by user code to trap into kernel and execute system calls.
- **Interrupts and Device Drivers**: Device drivers manage particular devices and handle interrupts. The console driver is an example of a driver that accepts characters from the user and buffers them for reading by user processes.
- **Scheduling**: xv6 uses round-robin scheduler to time-share the CPU among processes. It switched between processes when a process waits for I/O, a child process, or after a timer interrupt
- **File System**: The xv6 file system provides files, directories and pathnames. It uses a buffer cache to cache disk blocks and a logging layer to ensure atomicity of file system operations.
